                    <p>We have helped educate lawmakers on 12 pieces of passed or pending federal legislation to increase resources and protections for current and former foster youth, including the Improving Services for Older Youth in Foster Care Act (H.R.

                    NFYI members have had a huge impact on my office and the work we do. I truly rely on them to tell me what’s happening in our community and how the federal child welfare legislation we pass is being implemented. NFYI supports these young adults in speaking
                    effectively and in recognizing that their experience can be a strength. I’m thankful that they’ve made it possible for me to better serve my district and our nation's children and families.
